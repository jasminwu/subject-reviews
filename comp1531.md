# Software Engineering Fundamentals (COMP1531)

## Term Taken: 23T2

### Enjoyment: 1/5, Usefulness: 5/5, Manageability: 3/5


#### Summary
This course is definitely very useful and practical, but personally I didn't find the content that interesting. Essentially, you learn `Git`, `JavaScript/TypeScript` and HTTP request fundamentals, and most importantly, how to collaboratively work on a programming project.

Doing the course after `COMP2521` and alongside `COMP1521` meant I gained a bit of perspective comparing C with a much more high-level language like JavaScript.

As with most groupwork based courses, your experience with `COMP1531` is essentially entirely dependent on your group. Since you get to choose one of your group members, I would recommend choosing a friend who you know is reliable and is aiming for a similar mark to you.

#### Lectures
The content in this course is not very conceptually challenging, with the exception of HTTP requests which was confusing at first. After the first week, I stopped watching lectures and would quickly run through the lecture slides, which took around 30 mins each week.

I would probably not recommend attending the lectures live or watching them in full, since the course material is not that interesting and doesn't take too much effort to understand.

#### Tutorials
For the most part, I would skip the weekly tutorial and only attend the lab to meet up with my project group. The lab time is super useful for working on the project and for asking tutors questions; however, the tutorials are not that important as long as you are keeping up with lecture material.

One week, my tutor went through ways of using `JavaScript` array methods to write cleaner code, which I thought was helpful - however, this could have also been learnt through lecture slides or the `JavaScript` language documentation.

#### Weekly Assessments
In my experience, the labs for this course take longer than other first year courses; however, they are very useful for each iteration of the project. Be sure to start the labs early!

Since you can skip one week of labs without this affecting your mark, I ended up doing this for the final lab, as it was the most time consuming one.

#### Assignments
Iteration 0 and 1 are fairly straightforward, and you should be able to complete them without too much trouble.

I thought Iteration 2 was slightly harder because you needed to work with `Express.js`; however, one of the weekly labs helps you develop a good level of understanding before you start working on the project.

Iteration 3 was the only part of the project that felt more analogous to a assignment in other `COMP` courses, where you need to write a lot of code and think about how exactly to approach the problem. I found this iteration to be the most time consuming, but it also felt the most rewarding to complete.


#### Exam
This exam was a take-home programming assessment and is fairly straightforward if you have done your fair share of work in the group project.



#### Misc.
For this course, I would recommend downloading some relevant `VSCode` extensions for `JavaScript` and `TypeScript` to make your life easier. I used the following extensions:
- Babel JavaScript
- Error Lens
- GitLens
- npm Intellisense
- Prettier - Code formatter
- Todo Tree


I also created a script in my `.zshrc` file, which combines `git add`, `git commit -m` and `git push` into one command. This is useful for quickly committing and pushing your code to GitHub. The alias I used is:
