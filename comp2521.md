# Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP2521)

## Term Taken: 23T1

### Enjoyment: 4/5, Usefulness: 5/5, Manageability: 4/5

completing `COMP1511` and thus was less experienced with concepts like linked lists,
pointers, and debugging in C.*

#### Summary
Despite the initial learning curve, I found this course to be really useful.
It teaches you a lot of fundamental computer science concepts that you'll need for future courses,
and it's also a great way to improve your C skills. In contrast to something like `COMP1511`,
there's also a lot more focus on the theory and concepts behind the code you write, which I found super interesting.

Although the course doesn't provide much support for this, your life will be
so much easier if you figure out how to do your labs and assignments locally
(i.e. without TigerVNC or the SSH-FS VSCode extension). Although I didn't do this
when I completed the course, I definitely wish I had. It would have saved me a lot of time
and frustration!

I'd recommend setting up a debugger and downloading an extension for in-line error messaging.
If you prefer command-line debugging, there's also an optional lab in Week 6
that teaches you how to use `gdb` and `valgrind`.


#### Lectures
The lecture slides were very well written, which meant you could easily learn
the material without actually watching the lectures. I found myself mostly
reading the slides and then supplementing my knowledge with online YouTube videos
-- Abdul Bari and William Fiset were my go-to's.


#### Tutorials
As with tutorials for most CSE courses, I thought the tutorials
went through overly simple examples and were more
focused on repeating lecture material. Since the structure of tutorials very much
depends on who your tutor is, it might be useful to attend a few different classes
and find the one that best suits your learning style.

#### Weekly Assessments
I thought the labs for this course were a lot shorter and more manageable than
the ones for `COMP1521` and `COMP1531`. Every week, I was able to finish the
labs in my allocated lab time, which was a nice change from the other courses.

The quizzes are probably the hardest assessment component to get high marks in.
Each week, there will be probably at least one question that will trip you up.
However, going back and reviewing quiz answers is a great way to find weaknesses
and improve your understanding of the course material.

#### Assignments
As for any `COMP` course, I would recommend starting assessments as early as possible.
Since this course doesn't have autotests like `COMP1511` and `COMP1521`, it's really important to
read the spec and do your own testing. Writing tests before implementation is a great way to
make sure you don't miss any edge cases.


#### Exam
Compared to other first-year CSE courses, the exam for this course was more manageable
and it was much more likely that you can finish all the questions in the allocated time.

In terms of revision, [this repo](https://gist.github.com/jedavidson/1a99b8944897d532271fe164d4ce3049)
has some very useful and relevant questions to practice with.
Although I didn't do much revision for the exam as I had a lot of other stuff on my plate at the time,
if I could go back and do it again I would definitely do more practice questions.
