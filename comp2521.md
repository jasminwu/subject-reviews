# Data Structures and Algorithms (COMP2521)

## Term Taken: 23T1

### Enjoyment: 4/5, Usefulness: 5/5, Manageability: 4/5

I probably had a bit of a unique experience with this course, as I did it without
completing COMP1511 and thus was less experienced with concepts like linked lists,
pointers, and debugging in C.

Despite the initial learning curve, I found this course to be really useful.
The lecture slides were very well written, which meant you could easily learn
the material without actually watching the lectures. I found myself mostly
reading the slides and then supplementing my knowledge with online YouTube videos
-- Abdul Bari and William Fiset were my go-to's.

I thought the labs for this course were a lot shorter and more manageable than
the ones for `COMP1521` and `COMP1531`. Every week, I was able to finish the
labs in my allocated lab time, which was a nice change from the other courses.

As for any `COMP` course, I would recommend starting assessments as early as possible.
Since this course doesn't have autotests like `COMP1511` and `COMP1521`, it's really important to
read the spec and do your own testing. Writing tests before implementation is a great way to
make sure you don't miss any edge cases.

Although the course doesn't provide much support for this, your life will be
so much easier if you figure out how to do your labs and assignments locally
(i.e. without TigerVNC or the SSH-FS VSCode extension). Although I didn't do this
when I completed the course, I definitely wish I had. It would have saved me a lot of time
and frustration!

I'd recommend setting up a debugger and downloading an extension for in-line error messaging.
If you prefer command-line debugging, there's also an optional lab in Week 6
that teaches you how to use `gdb` and `valgrind`.

For exam preparation, [this repo](https://gist.github.com/jedavidson/1a99b8944897d532271fe164d4ce3049)
has some very useful and relevant questions to practice with.
Although I didn't do much revision for the exam as I had a lot of other stuff on my plate at the time,
if I could go back and do it again I would definitely do more practice questions.
